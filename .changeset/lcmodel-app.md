New app: LCModel preprocesses single-voxel MR spectroscopy with FID-A and fits it with LCModel, both as Rust ports compiled to WebAssembly. It reads Siemens twix, GE P-files, Siemens RDA and DICOM, Philips SPAR/SDAT, NIfTI-MRS, Bruker and LCModel .RAW files and pairs each spectrum with its water reference. FID-A's automatic pipelines combine coils, remove bad averages, correct drift by spectral registration and, for SPECIAL, combine the ISIS subspectra; they agree with FID-A in GNU Octave to within 10^-5 Hz. The LCModel port writes the same .TABLE and .COORD numbers as the Fortran on LCModel's test case. Nine basis sets simulated with FID-A (PRESS, STEAM, semi-LASER and SPECIAL at 1.5, 3 and 7 T) are offered; the app recommends the one that matches the data's field strength, sequence and echo time and explains any mismatch, or takes the user's own .BASIS file. Results are a fit plot, per-metabolite curves, the concentration table and downloads of the LCModel files.

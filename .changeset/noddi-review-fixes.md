Cancelling NODDI input preparation, mask reading or map compression now prevents late results and permits retry. Mask reading blocks fitting and requires a single 3D mask. Model choices survive replacement imports and examples, including when single-shell data temporarily prevents NODDI. Its AMICO fit uses the shared strict b0 cutoff, so a volume with b = 50 s/mm² remains diffusion weighted rather than entering the mean b0. The committed WebAssembly module includes this correction.

The shared diffusion reader pairs a single optional bval or bvec with a sole image independently. Supplying FSL `bvals` without `bvecs` now preserves the b-values for workflows that do not need gradient directions.

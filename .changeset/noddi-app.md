NODDI is a new app that fits diffusion tensor and NODDI maps to a DWI in the browser. Load a DWI NIfTI with its bval and bvec, or a DICOM diffusion series, and choose Fit models. The tensor fit (weighted or ordinary least squares, on the b0 volumes and the lowest shell) gives FA, MD, AD, RD, S0 and the principal direction. With two or more shells, NODDI by AMICO gives ICVF, ISOVF, ODI and the fibre direction; with one shell the app says so and fits the tensor only. The fit uses an Otsu threshold of the mean b0 as the brain mask, or a mask you supply on the DWI grid, and runs in Web Workers with a cancel. Every map downloads with its BIDS diffusion derivative name, for example `sub-01_model-noddi_param-icvf_dwimap.nii.gz`.

`@neurodesk/noddi` holds the WebAssembly fit, built from the Rust crates in `exes/dwi`. Its NODDI fit is a port of AMICO 1.5.4, the last BSD-licensed release, and agrees with AMICO 1.5.4 to a median of 1e-4 in white matter. It rotates each atom exactly instead of through AMICO's 1° lookup table.

`readDiffusionSeries` in `@neurodesk/runtime-support/dcm2niix-client` returns each image with its bval, bvec and sidecar, from NIfTI files or a converted DICOM series. FSL's `bvals` and `bvecs` files count as gradients, with or without a stem: the image readers no longer pass them to dcm2niix as DICOM, and a page drop sends them to an app's gradients input.

`createNiftiFromData` writes a 4D map when `dims` has a fourth entry greater than 1, so a direction map can be saved as three frames.

SynthSR builds with npm 12, whose `npm pack --json` prints an object instead of an array.

# carotid-flow

## 0.1.20260930

### Patch Changes

- Every app now opens on its workspace and shows live status only in the bottom bar: a short message, a progress bar, elapsed time and a cancel × that appears while a run can be cancelled. Start pages, landing overlays and welcome modals are gone, and their copy moved to About. Every app has a technical log below the viewer that starts collapsed. Sidebar help longer than 90 characters moved into info tooltips or About, and each sidebar has one primary action. `ProgressManager` now drives the design-system footer, including the elapsed counter and the cancel button.

  The shared example selector shows one short line once an example loads; the description and expected result moved to a tooltip beside the Example label. NiiMath gained the shared layout tabs and About dialog and no longer ships app CSS.

## 0.1.20260924

### Minor Changes

- 39a9ea5: New app: Carotid Flow finds both carotid arteries in a gated phase-contrast neck slice and plots their flow over the cardiac cycle, with peak, time average and pulsatility index, a CSV of the curves and a NIfTI of the carotid labels. Signed velocity gives flow in ml/min: arteries are told from veins by direction and pulse, and each carotid is the artery carrying most flow on its side; on the open example (PCMCalculator's test data) the right carotid is within 6 % of PCMCalculator's manual measurement. Unsigned speed images go through a port of the requesting lab's MATLAB script, which names left and right from the image orientation where the script called the patient's right carotid the left one. Shared file I/O gains `readNiftiFrames`, which reads every frame of a 4D NIfTI.

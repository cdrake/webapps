## 0.3.20261018

### Minor Changes

- NODDI now extracts a MindGrab brain mask from the mean b0 before fitting when no mask is supplied. The shared MindGrab runtime exposes brain-mask extraction with its existing backend selection and cancellation support. The app stages the pinned model runtimes locally for offline use; a supplied mask still bypasses extraction.

### Patch Changes

- 7c0d201: Restore the last committed image after cancelled or failed viewer loads. Share queued volume previews across NODDI, Degibbs, N4 and Dwidenoise, retaining source files and calibrated map ranges while rollback finishes before controls unlock.

## 0.2.20261018

### Minor Changes

- 0511cd7: NODDI is a new app that fits diffusion tensor and NODDI maps to a DWI in the browser. Load a DWI NIfTI with its bval and bvec, or a DICOM diffusion series, and choose Fit models. The tensor fit (weighted or ordinary least squares, on the b0 volumes and the shells up to b = 1200 s/mm², or the lowest shell when none is that low) gives FA, MD, AD, RD, S0 and the principal direction. With two or more shells, NODDI by AMICO gives ICVF, ISOVF, ODI and the fibre direction; with one shell the app says so and fits the tensor only. The fit uses an Otsu threshold of the mean b0 as the brain mask, or a mask you supply on the DWI grid, and runs in Web Workers with a cancel. Every map downloads with its BIDS diffusion derivative name, for example `sub-01_model-noddi_param-icvf_dwimap.nii.gz`.

  `@neurodesk/noddi` holds the WebAssembly fit, built from the Rust crates in `exes/dwi`. Its NODDI fit is a port of AMICO 1.5.4, the last BSD-licensed release, and agrees with AMICO 1.5.4 to a median of 1e-4 in white matter. It rotates each atom exactly instead of through AMICO's 1° lookup table.

  `readDiffusionSeries` in `@neurodesk/runtime-support/dcm2niix-client` returns each image with its bval, bvec and sidecar, from NIfTI files or a converted DICOM series. FSL's `bvals` and `bvecs` files count as gradients, with or without a stem: the image readers no longer pass them to dcm2niix as DICOM, and a page drop sends them to an app's gradients input.

  `createNiftiFromData` writes a 4D map when `dims` has a fourth entry greater than 1, so a direction map can be saved as three frames.

### Patch Changes

- a07f659: Cancelling NODDI input preparation, mask reading or map compression now prevents late results and permits retry. Mask reading blocks fitting and requires a single 3D mask. Model choices survive replacement imports and examples, including when single-shell data temporarily prevents NODDI. Its AMICO fit uses the shared strict b0 cutoff, so a volume with b = 50 s/mm² remains diffusion weighted rather than entering the mean b0. The committed WebAssembly module includes this correction.

  The shared diffusion reader pairs a single optional bval or bvec with a sole image independently. Supplying FSL `bvals` without `bvecs` now preserves the b-values for workflows that do not need gradient directions.

# Greedy

Greedy performs affine NMI or affine plus nonlinear stationary-velocity NMI
registration entirely in the browser. The interface keeps moving, stationary,
and resliced images visible in separate linked panels. NiiVue provides the
viewers, dcm2niix converts DICOM inputs, MindGrab brain extracts custom images,
and the threaded `@neurodesk/greedy` WebAssembly package performs registration.

The supplied examples are already brain extracted. A custom input is flagged
as not brain extracted, and a **Brain extract** button under each image runs
MindGrab on demand. Registration itself never modifies the inputs; a scan that
still includes scalp registers with artifacts, so the technical log notes it.

## Example data

The registration-family examples live in the `neurodeskorg/webapps` Hugging
Face dataset under `reg/templates` and `reg/moving`. From the webapps repository
root, prepare and upload the two Greedy examples with:

```bash
cd /Users/chris/src/webapps
GREEDY_DATA_SOURCE=${GREEDY_DATA_SOURCE:-../cfireants/validate/medium}
mkdir -p reg/templates reg/moving
cp "$GREEDY_DATA_SOURCE/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz" reg/templates/
cp "$GREEDY_DATA_SOURCE/t1_brain.nii.gz" reg/moving/
hf auth login
hf upload neurodeskorg/webapps ./reg reg --repo-type dataset
```

The app pins dataset revision `544f1362f367355e61a85e0694f5075aba2792b6`
so releases remain reproducible.

## Build and test

The Greedy executable source is in `exes/greedy`. Its browser runtime is built
into the ignored `packages/greedy/wasm` directory and copied into the app build
alongside MindGrab's runtime files:

```bash
pnpm --filter @neurodesk/greedy build:wasm
pnpm --filter @neurodesk/greedy test
pnpm --filter greedy build
pnpm --filter greedy test:e2e
```

Hugging Face stores example data. The standalone web archive, including the
generated browser runtime, is attached to each `greedy-v…` GitHub Release.

## MindGrab release note

The app pins `@brainchop/mindgrab` `0.1.20260813`. In that release, a failed or
timed-out WASM startup can remain cached; reload the page before retrying brain
extraction. [brainchopC pull request #13](https://github.com/neuroneural/brainchopC/pull/13)
fixes startup reporting and retry behavior and will be adopted with the next
MindGrab release. When upgrading, rebuild the app and rerun the unit, browser,
and interactive brain-extraction checks before removing this note.

## Agent automation

The published `automation.json` describes the typed browser operation. Desktop
MCP uses the same processing function as the Run button and returns the exact
output files with input and artifact checksums. See
[desktop automation](../../packages/desktop/AUTOMATION.md) for connection details.

`register` requires `moving` and `fixed` image roles. `method` is `affine` by
default or `deformable`. The operation returns the registered NIfTI and the
actual affine matrix. Deformable runs also return the displacement field.
The three image viewers expose their crosshairs and layout tabs.
Both image roles accept NIfTI or DICOM. Ambiguous DICOM conversion requires an
explicit series selection; the operation never guesses roles from filenames.
